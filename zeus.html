            <h3> Zeus's Role</h3>
            <h4> Name</h4>
            <b>Zeus'</b> name is thought to have originated from the Ancient Greek word for "bright".
            The word has a close connection with dies, which is the Latin word for "day" and has a very ancient history.
            Therefore, many mythologists believe that <b>Zeus</b> is one of the oldest Greek gods.
            <br> <br> <br>
            <h3>Other Roles and Epithets</h3>
            Considered the ruler of heavens and the governor of weather, <b>Zeus</b> was also associated with wisdom and awareness, with authority and destiny, with battles and power.
            In fact, Homer says that before the fight between <b>Achilles</b> and <b>Hector</b>, <b>Zeus</b> weighed their lots and blessed the outcome.
            Further down, the poet even claims that <b>Zeus</b> owns two urns filled with ills and blessing - the gifts which he gives to every mortal in the amount he decides.
            <br> <br> <br>
            In relation to many other roles <b>Zeus</b> had, he acquired many different epothets. Some of them are: "ooath-keeper", "guest-patron", "all-Greek", and "savior".

            <h3> Titanomachy: War for Supremacy</h3>
            Thus, they had no problem in acknowledging his authority.
            Led by him - and helped by the one-eyed <b>Cyclopes</b> and the hundred-handed <b>Hecatoncheires</b> (<b>Zeus</b> freed all of them from <b>Cronus'</b> imprisonment) - the siblings overthrew <b>Cronus</b> and the <b>Titans</b> during a decade-long war called the <b>Titanomachy</b>.
            <br> <br> <br>
            <h3>Zeus, the Ruler of the Gods</h3>
            <b>Zeus</b> and his brothers drew lots to share the world between them.
            <b>Poseidon</b> got the sea, <b>Hades the underworld</b>, and <b>Zeus</b> the sky.
            Finally, <b>Zeus</b> was crowned to be the ruler of all Gods ane Men, referred to universally as father.

            <h3>Zeus's Women</h3>
            <h4>Zeus's wives</h4>
            According to hesiod, <b>Zeus</b> had the very same problem with his first wife, <b>Metis</b>.
            Warned that their child may be a threat to him, he decided to swallow his pregnant wife.
            Nevertheless, the child, fully grown and armored, was eventually born- but from the forehead of <b>Zeus</b>.
            It was none other than <b>Athena</b>, the goddess of wisdom herself.
            <br> <br>
            Afterward, <b>Zeus</b> married <b>Themis</b>, who bore him the <b>Horae</b> and the fates.
            His third wife was <b>Eurynome</b>, who brought the <b>Charites</b> to the world.
            His sister <b>Demeter</b> followed; she gave birth to <b>Persephone</b>.
            With his fifth wife, <b>Mnemosyne</b>, <b>Zeus</b> begot the Muses.
            After becoming <b>Zeus'</b> sixth wife, <b>Leto</b> became the mother of <b>Apollo</b> and <b>Artemis</b>.
            <br> <br>
            <b>Zeus'</b> seventh and final wife was his sister, <b>Hera</b>.
            Knowing her sympathy for animals, he wooed her as a virgin by transforming himself.
            <br> <br> <br>
            <h3>Zeus' lovers</h3>
            However, theirs would prove to be a bittersweet marriage, because <b>Zeus</b>, to say the least, was a promiscuous god.
            Bearing the shape of many different animals, he had numerous love affairs with many nymphs and mortals, which made <b>Hera</b> jealous; some say that, when she scolded him for this, disguised as a serpent, he even slept with his mother,<b>Rhea</b>.
            Consequently, many gods and heroes are <b>Zeus'</b> children.
            It's impossible to list them all.
