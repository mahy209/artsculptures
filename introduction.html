<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>Late Classical indicates Greek art produced between 400 and 323 B.C., and Hellenistic art was made from 323 to 146 B.C. The most important function of Greek sculpture was to honor gods and goddesses. Statues were placed in temples or were carved as part of a temple. ... Greek sculpture changed with Greek civilization. <br> <br>
--The real influence of Hellenistic Statues and Reliefs actually occurred 1600-1700 years later when it was "rediscovered" by artists of the Early Renaissance in Italy, after which it formed the cornerstone of European art for the next four centuries. In short, the Greeks get maximum points. <br> <br>
--The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. <br> <br>
--The biggest sculpture in the world used to be Mount Rushmore, with the busts of the four presidents standing 60 feet high. However, there are literally dozens of sculptures that stand taller thanMount Rushmore. The tallest is the Spring Temple Buddha inLushan,Henan. This statue stands 420 feet tall. <br><br>
--Bone and ivory carving had been produced in Egypt since about 5000 BCE, as part of the cultural traditions established during the late stone age (10000-5000 BCE), Then, from 2600 BCE onwards, came various stands of aegean art. notebly Minoan civilitation on crete, with its stone sculpture, Fresco painting, ceramics and metalwork. <br><br>
--Following a series if earthquakes, Minoan culture collapsed around 1425 BCE, and the mainland-based Mycenean art became the dominant type of greek culture- known for its ceramic pottery, carved gemstones and glass ornaments - Until about 1150 BCE, when they too were taken over - this time by invading Dorians. <br>
After this came the Greek "Dark Ages" -a 400-year period of chaos and fighting, when little if any art was produced.<br> <br>
--During the calmer 8th century BCE, however, a new culture of visual art began to emerge, involving pottery and some painting and sculpture, while Homer's lliad and the Odyssey were also Written around this time. <br>
However, sculptural development remained extremly slow until the Archaic Period (c.600-500 BCE).<br><br>
--During the Archaic and the Classical periods, most important Greek sculpture was of a religious character, made for temples which were usually dedicated to a single divinity. Divine statues were sculpted in the likeness of man, and were made in various materials and sizes. Other votive statues sttod inside and outside the temple as well as urns, images of scared animals, and other objects of a sculptural nature.  <br><br>
